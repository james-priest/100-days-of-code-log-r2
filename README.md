## 89. Mobile Device Debug with Chrome DevTools
**Day 89: April 27, 2018 - Friday**

**Project:** Google Udacity Nandegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![devtools1](assets/images/sm_2-lesson1-devtools1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/2-lesson1-devtools1.png)

**Progress:** Today's lesson detailed the need for responsive design and set the stage for how to develop and test sites designed for mobile devices, using a mobile-first approach.

Two methods of testing were discussed.

- Testing on an actual device
- Using DevTools' built-in emulator/simulator in lue of an actual device

The lesson covered using Chrome DevTools' device emulators. It then covered creating a bridge to a mobile device with USB debugging so that a site run on the device's installation of Chrome can be debugged on the development machine with DevTools.

## 80. Linux Containers on Windows (LCOW)
**Day 80: April 18, 2018 - Wednesday**

**Project:** Upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 v1709 Fall Creator's Update

[![lcow1](assets/images/sm_lcow1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lcow1.png)

I decided to make the switch to Windows 10. I had been hesitant to upgrade until I came across some new features that I couldn't do without.

Linux Bash Shell is one and **Linux Containers on Windows** is another...

Here's what it is and what it offers.

- **Linux Containers on Windows (LCOW)**
  - Baked-in Docker support
  - Think native Docker support on Windows without Hyper-V or VirtualBox overhead
    - That means there's no VM or Hyper-V involved (unless you want), so Linux Containers run on Windows itself using built in container support.
  - Allows you to run other virtualization systems such as VMware Workstation
  - Supports Windows and Linux containers running side-by-side via LCOW

Docker for Windows & LCOW will now allow you to spin up containers for both environments. This was stated in a Docker blog post:

> "Developers will be able to more easily build and test mixed Windows/Linux Docker applications by running containers for both platforms side-by-side on the same system."

**Progress:** Installed Edge version of Docker for Windows Desktop app. This turned on certain Windows features such as **Containers** and **Hyper-V**.

Enabling Hyper-V did prevent VMware from running due to issues with VMware running under hypervisor. This was solved by issuing the following command thru elevated Cmd prompt.

```bash
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```

## 79. Linux Bash Shell on Windows (WSL)
**Day 79: April 17, 2018 - Tuesday**

**Project:** Upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 v1709 Fall Creator's Update

[![wsl1](assets/images/sm_wsl1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/wsl1.png)

I decided to make the switch to Windows 10. I had been hesitant to upgrade until I came across some new features that I couldn't do without.

Linux Bash Shell is one...

**Progress:** Once Windows was up and running properly, I had to turn this feature on. It's under *Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features On Or Off*. From there you enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" option.

After you enable the feature you must install a Linux distribution from the Windows Store. I chose Ubuntu although there are many others. Once installed, I was good to go.

[![wsl2](assets/images/sm_wsl2.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/wsl2.png)

Here are some highlights.

- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
  - Used to be called Bash on Ubuntu on Windows
  - Think full Ubuntu or other distro (SUSE, Debian, Kali, etc) with native Bash shell
  - Runs native Linux command-line tools (vim, sed, awk, etc) & first-line packages (Ruby, Python, etc.)
  - Can use `apt` or `apt-get` to install packages

Now I can do things like run Ruby and Jekyll right from Windows rather than incur the overhead of running a build system in a Linux VM. That will help with this blog in particular.

## 78. Windows 10 Upgrade
**Day 78: April 14-16, 2018 - Saturday-Monday**

**Project:** Upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 v1709 Fall Creator's Update

[![Windows 10](assets/images/sm_windows10-laptop.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/windows10-laptop.png)

I finally decided to make the switch to Windows 10. I had been hesitant to upgrade because I had everything fine-tuned and working beautifully on Win 8.1.

I figured I would wait until a must have feature emerged in Windows 10 that I couldn't do without. There were two...

1. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
2. **Linux Containers on Windows (LCOW)**

More on these two features in upcoming posts.

**Progress:** This took 3+ days due to issues with the Media Creation Tool and my slow internet connection. The tool would fail the installation after a 5-6 hour download. It would then start whole process over again.

I was able to fix what turned out to be permissions issues on the filesystem, registry, & firewall. I also virus scanned the system to make no infections were causing the problem.

Once this was done, I created installation media and did the following.

- Downloaded all laptop mfg system drivers
- Upgraded the Bios
- Uninstalled unnecessary or incompatible applications
- Tidied up the system prior to install

Once the upgrade was done I:

- Installed new system drivers
- Downloaded new updates
- Debugged post-upgrade system issues (no sound, missing utility apps, etc.)

## 77. Azure Developer Tour
**Day 77: April 13, 2018 - Friday**

**Project:** Azure Research and Evaluation

[![Azure3](assets/images/sm_azure3.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/azure3.png)

**Progress:** I attended the Azure Developer Tour in Los Angeles earlier this week. It was a one-day event that covered the following.

- App Service - (Web Apps, Web App Containers, Functions Apps, etc.)
- DevOps / VMs
- Databases
- Containers / Serverless
- AI / Machine Learning

This was a great experience. I got a chance to see how easy it is to host services in the cloud and also got some exposure to new technologies I didn't realize were ready for prime-time.

You can manage your services through a cool dashboard.

[![Azure1](assets/images/sm_azure1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/azure1.png)

You can access your app and write code through their App Service Editor which works Visual Studio Code. It has Version Control (Git), a File System Browser, and Integrated Debugger.

## 66. Web Storage Pt4 - Google's Storage Recommendations
**Day 66: April 2, 2018 - Monday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3)

[![15-3](assets/images/sm_chap15-3.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chap15-3.png)

**Progress:** This lesson starts by describing the performance pitfalls of some of these storage techniques including size limitations and synchronous-only blocking operations.

It then gets into Google's recommendation for specific storage methods based on browser adoption and performance considerations. These are IndexedDB & Cache API which are used extensively with Service Workers to provide good *offline first* user experience.

It describes the inherent limitations of other storage methods.

- **Web Storage** (e.g LocalStorage and SessionStorage) is synchronous, has no Web Worker support and is size and type (strings only) limited
- **Cookies** have their uses but are synchronous, lack web worker support and are also size-limited.
- **Web SQL** does not have broad browser support and its use is not recommended.
- The **File System API** is not supported on any browser besides Chrome.
- The **File API** is being improved in the File and Directory Entries API and File API specs but neither is sufficiently mature or standardized to encourage widespread adoption yet.

## 65. Web Storage Pt3 - HTML5 Storage APIs
**Day 65: April 1, 2018 - Sunday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3)

[![15-2](assets/images/sm_chap15-2.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chap15-2.png)

**Progress:** This discusses and breaks down the different HTML5 storage APIs and how they compare and contrast to old style cookies.

This includes:

1. Local Storage (Web Storage)
2. Session Storage (Web Storage)
3. IndexedDB
4. Web SQL (`deprecated`)
5. Filesystem API (`deprecated`)

## 64. Web Storage Pt2 - Namespace Patterns
**Day 64: March 31, 2018 - Saturday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3)

```js
// IIFE namespace pattern
var namespace = namespace || {};

/* here a namespace object is passed as a function parameter.
 * this allows us to assign public methods and properties to it. */
(function( o ){
    o.foo = "foo";
    o.bar = function(){
        return "bar";
    };
})(namespace);
```

**Progress:** Much of my cert study material puts code right in the global namespace. This is done to keep proof-of-concept code simple and under control but it misses an opportunity to reinforce good coding practices.

Today I took the time to re-write code to get and set cookies using four different namespace patterns from Addy Osmani's [Essential JavaScript Namespacing Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/#beginners).

The namespace patterns include:

1. Single global variable
2. Object literal notation
3. Nested namespace pattern
4. Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

The notes explaining how to use these four patterns are here: [Chapter 15 - Web Storage: Structuring code with Namespace patterns](CH15-WebStorage.html#3-structuring-code-with-namespace-patterns).

## 62. JS Tutorial Pt13 - Polymorphism
**Day 62: March 29, 2018 - Thursday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson covers polymorphism in JavaScript. It starts with an example of polymorphism in C# and shows how to accomplish the same task with JavaScript.

```js
 // Shape object is be the base object
var Shape = function () { };

// Add draw function to the Shape prototype
// Objects derived from Shape will be able to override the draw() method
Shape.prototype.draw = function () {
    return "I am a generic shape";
};

// Create a Circle object
var Circle = function () { }

// Make shape the parent for Circle
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);

// Circle object overrides draw() method
Circle.prototype.draw = function () {
    return "I am a circle";
};
var Square = function () { };
Square.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Square.prototype.draw = function () {
    return "I am a square";
};

var Triangle = function () { };
Triangle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);

var shapes = [new Shape(), new Circle(), new Square(), new Triangle()];

shapes.forEach(function (shape) {
    document.write(shape.draw() + "<br/>");
});
```

**Output**

```text
I am a generic shape
I am a circle
I am a square
I am a generic shape
```

## 61. JS Tutorial Pt12 - Object Reflection
**Day 61: March 28, 2018 - Wednesday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson covers object reflection in JavaScript. In C# reflection allows us to inspect meta data of assemblies, modules, and types. In JavaScript it allows the examination of objects with regards to the object's properties, methods, and inheritance.

```js
var Employee = function (firstName, lastName, gender, email) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.email = email;
}

Employee.prototype.getFullName = function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
}

Employee.prototype.getEmail = function () {
    return this.email;
}

Employee.prototype.getGender = function () {
    return this.gender;
}

var employee1 = new Employee("Mark", "Matt", "Male", "a@a.com");

for (var property in employee1) {
    document.write(property + " : " + employee1[property] + "<br/>");
}
```

**Output**

```text
firstName: Mark
lastName: Matt
gender: Male
email: a@a.com
getFullName: function () { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; }
getEmail: function () { return this.email; }
getGender: function () { return this.gender; }
```

## 60. JS Tutorial Pt11 - Abstract Classes
**Day 60: March 27, 2018 - Tuesday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson covers abstract classes which cannot be instantiated in an of themselves but rather, act as a base class from which create a sub-class from.

```js
// Create a Shape object which is abstract
var Shape = function () {
    this.shapeName = "None";
    throw new Error("Cannot create an instance of abstract class");
};

// Add draw function to the Shape prototype
// Objects derived from Shape should be able to call draw() method
Shape.prototype.draw = function () {
    return "Drawing " + this.shapeName;
};

// Create a Circle object
var Circle = function (shapeName) {
    this.shapeName = shapeName;
};

// Make shape the parent for Circle
// Object.create() allows to create an object without using constructor
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);

var circle = new Circle("Circle");
// Since Circle inherits from abstract Shape object, it can call draw() method
document.write(circle.draw());

alert(circle instanceof Circle); // Returns true
alert(circle instanceof Shape);  // Returns true
```

## 59. JS Tutorial Pt10 - Inheritance in JavaScript
**Day 59: March 26, 2018 - Monday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson covers the basics of object inheritance in ES5. We do this using a pattern that sets a derived object 's prototype to the base object. This allows the derived object access to the base object's prototype methods and properties.

```js
// Employee will be the base object (Similar to base class in C#)
var Employee = function (name) {
    this.name = name;
};

// getName() function is added to the base object (Employee)
Employee.prototype.getName = function () {
    return this.name;
};

// PermanentEmployee will be the derived object
var PermanentEmployee = function (annualSalary) {
    this.annualSalary = annualSalary;
};

// Use prototype to set Employee as the base object for PermanentEmployee
PermanentEmployee.prototype = new Employee("Mark");

var pe = new PermanentEmployee(50000);
// Derived object (permanentEmployee) can see the
// base object (Employee) getName() method
document.write(pe.getName());

alert(pe instanceof Employee);          // Returns true
alert(pe instanceof PermanentEmployee); // Returns true
```

## 58. JS Tutorial Pt9 - Overriding JS functions
**Day 58: March 25, 2018 - Sunday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson covers the process of overriding a function on the prototype object in cases where this behavior is desired.

The lesson covers:

- Creating an object constructor
- Defining a member function on the prototype object.
- Overriding that prototype member function with a new function definition

```js
function Employee(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Employee.prototype.getName = function () {
    return this.name;
}

function GetEmployeeDetails() {
    Employee.prototype.getName = function () {
        return this.name.toUpperCase();
    }

    var e1 = new Employee("Mark");
    var e2 = new Employee("Sara");

    document.write("e1.name = " + e1.getName() + "<br/>");
    document.write("e2.name = " + e2.getName() + "<br/>");
}

GetEmployeeDetails();
```

## 57. JS Tutorial Pt8 - The Prototype Object
**Day 57: March 24, 2018 - Saturday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson covers the prototype object and how to add methods you wish to make public to this object in order to limit memory consumption.

The lesson covers:

- Creating a privileged method for the function
- Creating the function as a static method
- Creating the function as a public method on the prototype object.

```js
function Employee(name) {
    // public instance field
    this.name = name;
}

// Public prototype method
Employee.prototype.getName = function() {
    return this.name;
};

var e1 = new Employee("Mark");
var e2 = new Employee("Sara");

document.write("e1.name = " + e1.getName() + "<br/>"); // Mark
document.write("e2.name = " + e2.getName() + "<br/>"); // Sara
```

## 56. JS Tutorial Pt7 - Static Fields & Methods
**Day 56: March 23, 2018 - Friday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson covers what a static member is and how to create one. It also discusses when to use this construct.

A static member is a static field (variable) or static method (function). The term static means that there is only ever one copy created in memory for that field or method.

```js
function Shape(shapeName) {
    // Instance field
    this.ShapeName = shapeName;

    // Static field
    Shape.Count = ++Shape.Count || 1;

    // Static method
    Shape.ShowCount = function() {
        return Shape.Count;
    };
}

var shape1 = new Shape('Circle');
var shape2 = new Shape('Rectangle');
var shape3 = new Shape('triangle');

document.write('Shape.Count = ' + Shape.ShowCount());  // Shape.Count = 3
```

Five instances of an object can be created from a constructor function but if that constructor defines a static member, only one copy of that member will be created in memory.

Here are more complete examples: [Object Oriented JavaScript - Static Members in JavaScript](OO-JavaScript.html#59-static-members-in-javascript).

## 55. JS Tutorial Pt6 - Property Getters & Setters
**Day 55: March 22, 2018 - Thursday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** Today we cover getters and setters in JavaScript. This allows us to control how we update private properties and control what is returned upon request. It provides encapsulation which is one of the four pillars of object-oriented design.

Here is an example in code.

```js
function Employee(name, age) {
    var _name = name;
    var _age = age;

    Object.defineProperty(this, 'age', {
        get: function () {
            return _age;
        },
        set: function (value) {
            if (value > 100 || value < 1) {
                alert("Invalid age");
            } else {
                _age = value;
            }
        }
    });

    Object.defineProperty(this, "name", {
        get: function () {
            return _name;
        }
    });
}
```

## 54. JS Tutorial Pt5 - Private Members
**Day 54: March 21, 2018 - Wednesday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson dives deeper into how to create the kind of encapsulation found in traditional class-based inheritance structures of C# and Java.

```js
// JavaScript
function Employee(firstName, lastName) {
    // Private Field
    var privateFullName;

    // Public Fields
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    // Private Function
    var privateGetFullName = function () {
        privateFullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
        return privateFullName;
    };

    // Privileged Function
    this.privilegedGetFullName = function () {
        return privateGetFullName();
    };

    // Public Function
    Employee.prototype.publicGetFullName = function () {
        return this.privilegedGetFullName();
    };
}
```

This lesson covers:

- **Private fields** - variables that can only be accessed by private functions and privileged methods.
- **Public fields** - variables available outside the object.
- **Private functions** - available only to privileged methods or other private functions.
- **Privileged methods** - available both inside and outside the object. Has access to private fields and functions.
- **Public methods** - available inside and outside the object. No access to private fields or functions but can access privileged methods.

## 53. JS Tutorial Pt4 - Namespaces
**Day 53: March 20, 2018 - Tuesday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson takes the code scenario posed in the previous lesson and solves for it by creating namespaces. JavaScript does not have namespaces as such but uses objects to accomplish the same kind of encapsulation.

Furthermore, we can create nested namespaces by creating a nested object hierarchy. A nested namespace is a namespace inside another namespace.

```js
var myApp = myApp || {};
var myApp.utilities = myApp.utilities || {};

myApp.utilities.validateData = function(data) {
  // some code...
};
```

## 52. JS Tutorial Pt3 - Global Namespace Pollution
**Day 52: March 19, 2018 - Monday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson details the pitfalls of writing code that lives in the global namespace. Global namespace pollution occurs when we declare variables or functions globally which have the possibility of overwriting code from included libraries or third-parties.

This is most common in large code bases but can occur anytime variables, objects, or functions are being declared globally.

This lesson creates an example of how this can occur.

## 51. JS Tutorial Pt2 - Object Literal vs Constructor
**Day 51: March 18, 2018 - Sunday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** This lesson gets more in depth with the differences between using  literal notation to define a custom object vs using a constructor function to create one.

The lesson shows how an object literal is a singleton, and objects defined with a constructor and the `new` keyword are separate individual instances.

```js
// object literal notation
var employee = {
    name: "John"
}
```

```js
// constructor function
var emp = function () {
    this.name = "John";
}
// Create an instance of employee
var employee = new emp();
```

The bottom line is that when we need multiple instances we should use a constructor function. When one instance is needed we can define the object using literal notation.

## 50. JS Tutorial Pt1 - Object Oriented Programming
**Day 50: March 17, 2018 - Saturday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Object Oriented JavaScript)

**Progress:** Learned about two distinct ways to create custom objects in JavaScript.

1. Constructor functions
2. Object literal notation

The lesson covered code examples of each.

```js
// Constructor function
function Employee(firstName, lastName)
{
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    this.getFullName = function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}

var employee = new Employee("Pragim", "Tech");
```

```js
// Object literal notation
var employee = {
    firstName: "Pragim",
    lastName: "Tech",

    getFullName: function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}
```

## 49. VSCode from Scratch
**Day 49: March 16, 2018 - Friday**

**Project:** Reinstall Visual Studio Code & plugins

[![vscode plugins](assets/images/sm_vscode-plugins.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chap14-6.png)

**Progress:** Today I decided to wipe clean my Visual Studio Code installation and start fresh. I had many plug-ins installed that were using resources and keeping me from a streamlined coding experience.

I also had quite a few modifications to my user settings, including linting, code formatting, themes, icons, plugin settings, etc.

I did a number of things before a fresh install:

1. Made a list of all currently used plugins (so I could reinstall the ones I wanted)
2. Uninstalled Visual Studio Code
3. Renamed the `extensions` directory (to clear out old extensions)
4. Renamed the `Code` directory within %UserDir%/AppData/Roaming  (to start with a fresh user settings)
5. Installed fresh copy

Once this was done, I proceeded to install the extensions I wanted along with some new ones. Everything runs clean and smooth now.

## 34. WebSocket API
**Day 34: March 1, 2018 - Thursday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3)

[![10-2](assets/images/sm_chap10-2.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chap10-2.png)

**Progress:** This lesson covered the use of the WebSocket protocol which establishes a two-way, bidirectional connection between the browser and the web server.

This is done with little overhead (2 bytes) and no headers. The light weight structure of the WebSocket protocol makes is an easy choice for any real-time applications such as chat, gaming, and live content.

Here's a quick bullet list of take-away's:

- The WebSocket protocol provides a standardized way to establish a two-way (bi-directional) connection between the browser and the web server while keeping the connection open.
- The WebSocket object contains methods to open connections, send data, & close connections
- It contains the following events: `onclose`, `onmessage`, `onerror`, and `onopen`.
- You can check the `readyState` property on the WebSocket object to obtain the state of the connection.
- Use `ws://` for WebSocket protocol or `wss://` for secure WebSocket protocol.
- Timeouts, dropped connections, web farm implementations, and browser incompatibility are problems you must resolve when implementing WebSocket or you can use a pre-built library such as SignalR or Socket.IO.

## 33. Web Workers
**Day 33: February 28, 2018 - Wednesday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3)

[![9-2](assets/images/sm_chap9-2.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chap9-2.png)

**Progress:** This lesson covered the use of Web Workers as a non-blocking (async) way of performing work. The worker can send messages back to the spawning task by posting  messages to an event handler specified by the creator (calling script). Messages can be any object that can be serialized.

When messages are posted to and from the web worker, the message object is serialized. This **creates a copy** of the message, so the web worker and the creator never reference the same object.

Web workers also don't have access to the DOM. If something needs to be posted to the DOM then that has to happen in the form of a message sent back to the creator, and the creator must access the DOM as needed.

Here's a quick bullet list of take-away's:

- A web worker provides asynchronous code execution.
- Communication to and from the web worker is accomplished by using the `postMessage()` method.
- The `postMessage()` method accepts a serializable object.
- The web worker and the creator cannot access the same object since a copy is made.
- The web worker does not have access to DOM elements.

## 32. jQuery Ajax & Promises
**Day 32: February 27, 2018 - Tuesday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3)

[![9-1](assets/images/sm_chap9-1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chap9-1.png)

**Progress:** This lesson went into various asynchronous operations using jQuery ajax and jQuery promises. These are still in use as part of the jQuery library but not as modern an implementation as using ES6 Promises with the Fetch API.

Nonetheless, it's still helpful to know these patterns since a huge majority of code-bases are using jQuery's implementation. What was covered is the following:

- $.Deferred() object as a wrapper to the jquery promise() object
- jQuery .pipe() method for serialized(chained) async operations
- $.when() method for parallel async operations
- conditional async operations based on the result of prior async calls for both parallel and chained patterns

**Links:**

## 31. XMLHttpRequest & Ajax
**Day 31: February 26, 2018 - Monday**

**Project:** Study for MS 70-480 Cert Exam (Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3)

[![8-1](assets/images/sm_chap8-1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chap8-1.png)

**Progress:** Covered using Ajax to access Web Services created with node.js. The web services were created to use Representational State Transfer (REST) and are also known as RESTful services.

REST attempts to use standard operations of HTTP by mapping _create_, _retrieve_, _update_, & _delete (CRUD) operations to HTTP methods.

The object that makes this call from the browser DOM is the XMLHttpRequest object. It is either invoked directly, or through one of jQuery's many wrapper methods. The ones I used were the following:

- Async XMLHttpRequest (for old-school backwards compatability)
- $.ajax()
- $.get()
- $.getJSON()
- $.post()

**Links:** [AJAX examples on GitHub](https://github.com/james-priest/node_samples/tree/master/math_service) - These are some XMLHttpRequests() & jQuery $.ajax() methods

[![IDB 7](assets/images/sm_lesson4-idb7.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lesson4-idb7.png)

**Progress:** Learned about IndexedDB and how it can be used by all the major browsers to provide database capabilities. This is a NoSQL rather than relational database and is perfectly suited to persist data related to a site.

This lesson also covers some of the deficiencies inherent in the asynchronous implementations of IndexedDB. It was created before Promises and therefore uses a messy callback architecture.

We look at using a tiny wrapper library written by Jake Archibald which allows us to use Promises rather than events.

## 10. Triggering a Service Worker Update
**Day 10: February 5, 2018 - Monday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

[![service worker 19](assets/images/sm_lesson3-service-worker19.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lesson3-service-worker19.png)

**Progress:** Learned how to trigger a cache and Service Worker update for versioned web content. This provides the user with a notification and creates a new cache store instance separate from the existing cache store.

The versioning of caches stores ensures that the current Service Worker does not experience any interruptions servicing it's pages when new content arrives.

The user is given the option of updating immediately or dismissing the notification and updating with the normal Service Worker lifecycle. This occurs when the old Service Worker is released.

## 9. Update Notification with Service Workers
**Day 9: February 4, 2018 - Sunday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

[![service worker 18](assets/images/sm_lesson3-service-worker18.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lesson3-service-worker18.png)

**Progress:** Learned how to provide the user with an update notification when new content is available through a new Service Worker instance.

When a new Service Worker instance is installed it remains in a 'waiting' state until the current Service Worker is done servicing all pages in its scope and is released. This usually requires navigating off site and back again.

These changes alert the user to new content so they may update with a button click.

## 8. Updating Static Cache
**Day 8: February 3, 2018 - Saturday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

[![service worker 15](assets/images/sm_lesson3-service-worker15.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lesson3-service-worker15.png)

**Progress:** Learned how to update static cache for a site by creating versioned cache stores.

By changing the name of a cache store from say 'my-app-v1' to 'my-app-v2' we are causing the service worker to spin up a new instance. The new service worker instance gets installed but not activated until the old service worker is released.

We create a separate cache store because we don't want to disrupt the cache that's already being used by the old service worker and the pages it controls.

Once the old service worker is released, we delete the old cache store so the next page load gets the latest resources from the new cache.

## 7. Cache API
**Day 7: February 2, 2018 - Friday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

[![service worker](assets/images/sm_lesson3-service-worker13.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lesson3-service-worker13.png)

**Progress:** Learned the basics of the [Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) for storing offline versions of a site. This includes the use of:

- [CacheStorage.open()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage/open)<br>
  Returns a Promise that resolves to the Cache object matching the cacheName (a new cache is created if it doesn't already exist.)
- [Cache.put(request, response)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/put)<br>
  Takes both a request and its response and adds it to the given cache.
- [Cache.add(request)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/add)<br>
  Takes a URL, retrieves it and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. This is functionally equivalent to calling fetch(), then using Cache.put() to add the results to the cache.
- [Cache.match(request, options)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/match)<br>
  Returns a Promise that resolves to the response associated with the first matching request in the Cache object.
- [Cache.addAll(requests)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/addAll)<br>
  Takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response objects to the given cache.
- [Cache.matchAll(request, options)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/matchAll)<br>
  Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of all matching requests in the Cache object.

Also learned about the [install](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InstallEvent) and [activate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ExtendableEvent/waitUntil) events of a Service Worker.

## 6. Hijacking Requests
**Day 6: February 1, 2018 - Thursday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

[![dev tools](assets/images/sm_hijacking-requests1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/hijacking-requests1.png)

**Progress:** Learned about the following.
1. How to listen for and capture `fetch` events
1. How to use the `fetchEvent.respondWith()` method
1. Using `Fetch API` as a better and modern alternative to XMLHttpRequest.

Here's an example of this kind of event handling.

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
  // TODO: only respond to requests with a url ending in ".jpg"
  if ( event.request.url.endsWith( '.jpg' ) ) {
    event.respondWith(
      fetch( '/imgs/dr-evil.gif' )
    );
  }
});
```

## 5. Service Worker Dev Tools
**Day 5: January,31 2018 - Wednesday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

[![dev tools](assets/images/sm_chrome-dev-tools1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/chrome-dev-tools1.png)

**Progress:** Learned about [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html), the nightly build of Chrome with bleeding edge features. It can be run along side **Chrome Stable** but can often break as well. It receives a new feature push almost daily.

Chrome Stable has the Service Worker features already baked in and might be a better choice to test with since it is less likely to crash. That is what I have pictured above.

## 3. An Overview of the Service Worker
**Day 3: January,29 2018 - Monday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

[![service worker](assets/images/sm_lesson3-service-worker1.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lesson3-service-worker1.png)

**Progress:** Learned what the **Service Worker** is:
- a JavaScript file that sits between you and network requests.
- a type of **Web Worker** meaning it runs separately from your page.
- a process that is invisible to the user and that can't access the DOM.

But, it does control pages by intercepting requests as the browser makes them.

## 2. The Benefits of Offline First
**Day 2: January,28 2018 - Sunday**

**Project:** [Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google): Mobile Web track

**Progress:** Lesson 2: The Benefits of Offline First - Jake Archibald

The _Benefits of Offline First_ course was broken down into 13 segments. It discussed the use of **HTTP Cache** and laid out a new paradigm which loads content from cache first rather than relying on network connectivity to determine if content gets displayed.

This solves for all three of the following use case scenarios:
1. Great connectivity
1. Poor connectivity
1. Offline

_Offline First_ delivers the page (header and/or content) from cache FIRST, and THEN attempts to fetch content from the network.

Lastly, it introduces the **Service Worker**.

[![service worker](assets/images/sm_lesson2-service-worker.jpg)](assets/images/full-size/lesson2-service-worker.png)

It's billed as a new browser feature and a total game changer- the greatest paradigm shift since asynchronous operations and one that allows **you to control the network rather than the network control you**.
