- FCC Code Challenges

**Progress:**

- Wrapped up Time Map

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** Today's work was more organizational and productivity-based in nature but necessary nonetheless. It took me a while to come up with an aggressive but reasonable schedule.

My goal is to do 4 Pomodoros for each two-hour Study block (in blue).

### Day 4: June 15, 2017 - Thursday

**Today's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges

**Progress:**

- Completed some form element exercises
- Completed css class & id selectors

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** Today was a little light on the workload. It's funny how I can spend ALL day on the computer do code-related activities without actually coding. :/ Go figure...

The important thing is that I did get something done and posted. I'm keeping it pushin...

### Day 5: June 20, 2017 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges

**Progress:**

- Finished the HTML5 & CSS section

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")

**Thoughts:** So I skipped 5 days of postings & tweets but still was productive in my studies. I spend 8-10 hours in front of the computer daily; sometimes its directly related to learning and code challenges but half the time it's about reading about a new technology or configuring my dev environment or fine-tuning a process. It's constant learning and applying that knowledge.

The key is to get and find efficiencies in your daily process and turn those into routine...

### Day 6: June 22, 2017 - Thursday

**Today's Project(s):**

- FCC Code Challenges
- Learned about closures & module patterns in JavaScript

**Progress:**

- Finished the Gear Up for Success section of FCC (Joined FCC forum, Linked-In Alumni Network & Free Code Camp Group in Pasadena)

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/james-priest "james-priest's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")
- [JavaScript Module System Showdown: CommonJS vs AMD vs ES2015](https://t.co/l3SLLnxvZf "JavaScript article on auth0.com")

**Thoughts:** I'm taking time to read about technologies, methodologies and language conventions. Right now it's a jumble of information but I know eventually it will all start to click and make sense.

**Thoughts:** It's easy for me to get distracted with the six different projects working on at the same time.  I need to limit my WIP in order to make consistent headway.
